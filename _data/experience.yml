  summary:  I am a software engineer at Intel working on the Quartus Software Tools, my daily tasks include developing and debugging a A star path finding algorithm in a graph with 1 million + nodes, analyzing failing regression tests, writing scripts to automate development and etc.	    <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Worked on the "Quartus Prime" CAD software's backend algorithm and data structure with modern C++, in a codebase exceeding 1 million lines. Impacted thousands of users, contributing to generation of 3 billion+ annual revenue.</li><li>Mentoring new hires, providing guidance and feedback to help them develop new skills and shortening the onboarding time.</li><li>Led the design, testing, and deployment of a project that achieved and maintained 100% pass rate on the internal regression tests by analyzing & fixing bugs, made weekly reports to the management team.</li><li>Receiver of Intel's Quarterly Bonus+ reward for unique contribution in debugging non-determinism issues that involves concurrent read/write to a shared object across different teams.</li><li>Improved runtime by 30% and reduced memory usage by 2GB. Identified performance bottlenecks with profiling tools(VTune, GProf) and made improvements using techniques such as multithreading, pruning, cache optimization, heuristic tuning, data structure optimization and caching.</li><li>Designed a new graph that efficiently modelled the routing resources on an FPGA fabric and implemented the API for communicating with the rest of the subsystems.</li><li>Triaged/resolved multiple customer-facing bugs in a large code base.</li><li>Reengineered a new subsystem that decoupled the original monolithic application into modularized components,resulting in a more streamlined system architecture that provides more fault tolerance, and robustness. Implemented methods to serialize/deserialize intermediate snapshots for faster recovery.</li></ul>
